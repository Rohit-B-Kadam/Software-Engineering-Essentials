# Design Pattern

- Design pattern describe simple and elegant solution to specific problem in object-oriented software solution.
- It make our code more flexibility, extensibility, or portability.
- Design patterns can be implement in any standard object-oriented language like C++, Java, c# etc.
- It can take a little more work. but this effort will increase code flexibility and reusability.

Design pattern solve the most common problem face in developing software.

"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice" by Alexander.

In general, a pattern has four essential elements:
- Pattern Name : use to describe problem and solution.
- Problem Statement: describe when to apply pattern.
- Solution: describe way to solve problem
- Consequences: are the result and trade-offs of applying pattern.

## Our style of learning

we will first learn about problem and then way to solve that problem with code.

## Design pattern are categorise into 3 type:

1. Creational pattern
1. Structural pattern
1. Behavioural pattern

### Creational pattern

1. Abstract Factory
1. Builder
1. Factory Method
1. Prototype
1. Singleton

### Structural Pattern

1. Adapter
1. Bridge
1. Composite
1. Decorator
1. Facade
1. Flyweight
1. Proxy

### Behavioral Pattern

1. Chain of Responsibility
1. Command
1. Interpreter
1. Iterator
1. Mediator
1. Memento
1. Observer
1. State
1. Strategy
1. Template Method
1. Visitor
